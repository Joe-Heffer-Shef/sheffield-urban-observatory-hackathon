# Sheffield Urban Observatory Hackathon
A repository for all of the code produced during the Sheffield UO hackathon

## Hackathon purpose
For three days between the 11th and 14th of February, researchers from Sheffield and Newcastle University as well as developers from
DAFNI worked on the following three main themes [MT]:

* **MT1** - Getting Data onto DAFNI in a consistent and forward-thinking way. 
  * This should consider Urban Observatory data from both Sheffield and Newcastle to come up with an approach which works for both Urban Observatories.
  * The data held on DAFNI should be updated at appropriate intervals. For Sheffield, this will be making HTTP requests to an API and for Newcastle it will mean connecting to websockets. 

* **MT2** - Quality Assurance of Data
  * The people working on this theme will be given a data dump from both Newcastle and Sheffield Urban Observatories and they will work on creating some program which can analyse the data coming out of a variety of sensors to see if any of it is erroneous.
  * The outputs from this theme could be very creative and include machine learning style approaches as well as some kind of alerting for when sensors are deemed to be inaccurate.

* **MT3** - Visualisation of data
  * This ties in with direct data visualisation on DAFNI which is in the DAFNI backlog. The people working on this theme will be producing a standard way of visualising datasets. They should particularly focus on the comparison of Sheffield’s data to Newcastle’s data. This team will also be provided with a data dump.
  * This would be a good opportunity to explore Hicharts and other potential off-the-shelf visualisation options
  
## Teams
Throughout the three days, there were three teams looking into the three themes. This repository holds all of the code that was developed during
the course of the hackathon.
