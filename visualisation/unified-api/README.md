# Running locally

To run the project locally, you must have a version of Python 3 installed and must also have installed Cherrypy and the requests library:

`pip install cherrypy`
`pip install requests`

After these dependences have been installed, simply run `python api.py` from the home folder and the API will launch. From there, when changes to the code are made, the code will self-relaunch.
